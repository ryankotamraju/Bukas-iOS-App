This application is a simple project made for the purposes of providing the 
children of Virlanie Foundation with supplemental exercises to practice basic 
arithmetic. It prompts an addition, subtraction, or multiplication problem, 
and allows the user to input an answer, checking and providing optional 
assistance through the press of a button.
